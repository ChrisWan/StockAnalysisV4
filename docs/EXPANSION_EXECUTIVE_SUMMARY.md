def calculate_institutional_momentum(ticker):
    current_holders = ticker.institutional_holders
    # Compare with previous quarter data
    # Return momentum score (-1 to +1)

```

### **Analyst Sentiment Score**
```python
def calculate_analyst_sentiment(ticker):
    recommendations = ticker.recommendations
    recent_30d = recommendations[recommendations['Date'] > recent_date]
    
    upgrades = count_upgrades(recent_30d)
    downgrades = count_downgrades(recent_30d)
    
    sentiment_score = (upgrades - downgrades) / total_recommendations
    return sentiment_score  # -1 (bearish) to +1 (bullish)
